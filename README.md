# Tildagon Keyboard Demo

This is a demo app to show an on-screen keyboard which could replace the text input dialog currently used in the tildagon firmware. This will need to be ported over to be a dialog, but the functionality is all working.

## Features:
- Navigation around the keyboard layout using the left/right/up/down keys
- Quick navigation by wrapping moves around the end of the keyboard
- Moving of cursor within typed text to allow easier modification of text
